### What are ThreeFold Tokens?

The [ThreeFold Token](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/token_why) (TFT) is the currency of the new Internet. It represents a unit of reservation of capacity (compute, storage & application) on the largest peer-to-peer network of capacity on earth - [The ThreeFold Grid](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/grid_what). This new Internet is built by independent [farmers](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/what_is_a_farmer), who connect hardware from all around the globe to provide the necessary decentralised storage and compute for individuals and organizations. ThreeFold Farmers get rewarded with TFT for providing rented capacity to the ThreeFold Grid, and users pay farmers for capacity rented in TFT.

### Why get ThreeFold Tokens?

TFT supports the growth of the new Internet empowered by ThreeFold and its [open ecosystem](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/partners). A truly peer-to-peer Internet would be incomplete without a decentralized currency as a fair and trustworthy medium of exchange for all stakeholders involved. TFT allows the whole ThreeFold open ecosystem to enjoy the [benefits and the fairness](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/token_features) of a decentralized currency. That’s why we created the ThreeFold Token (TFT).
