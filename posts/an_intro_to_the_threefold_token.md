The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralised digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralised Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Network — it represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.

Capacity is a new high-demand market, and the TFT will be the medium of exchange for this commodity on the peer-to-peer internet brought by the ThreeFold Network. TFT synergistically connects the world of cloud and blockchain markets to the most scalable universal substrate without compromising, performance, security and privacy.

### How are ThreeFold Tokens created?
No ThreeFold Tokens have ever been minted. ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called “Farming”. Farming happens when active internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.

### 5 good reasons to buy ThreeFold Tokens

1. TFTs are exclusively generated when new capacity is added to the TF Grid. There are no centralized issuers. Tokens have not been created out of thin air.
2. While the threeFold Grid can expand, a maximum of 4 Billion TFTs can be in circulation. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders.
3. TFT lives on the Stellar Blockchain. TFT holders benefit from a big ecosystem of proven wallets and mediums of exchange.
4. By employing Stellar technology, TFT transactions and smart contracts are powered by one of the most energy-efficient blockchains available. Furthermore, TFT is the medium of exchange on the greenest internet network in the world.
5. The market for farming, cultivating and trading TFT is open to all. Anyone with internet connection, power supply and necessary harware can become a Farmer or trade ThreeFold tokens (TFT).
6. By buying, holding, and utilizing ThreeFold Tokens, you are actively supporting the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its use cases — creating a more sustainable, fair, and equally accessible Internet.

Important note: TFT's are not an investment instrument. It is the medium of exchange on the ThreeFold Grid, and is a mechanism to enable the Internet we believe is possible.
